   %h1 Mayfair Apartment

   %p This mansion block apartment in the heart of Mayfair was extensively remodelled and comprehensively refurbished to create a luxurious property in central London.

   %p Fittings, finishes and internal partitions were stripped out and the layout of the apartment was reconfigured to provide new bathrooms, en suite and kitchen facilities. Bespoke fitted cabinetry with integrated lighting was installed and custom made solid walnut doors and architraves were fabricated for the project.

   %p A fully automated home audio visual, lighting and security control system was seamlessly integrated into the design and specifically tailored to the property as part of a complete overhaul of the apartments electrical systems.

   %p New finishes were introduced throughout, including book matched Walnut burl veneer, smoked English Oak, Ostrich leather and vein matched marble cut from a single block.
