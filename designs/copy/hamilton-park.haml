%p In the garden of this semi-detached Georgian house within an Islington conservation area stood a small dilapidated brick building; an original annexe to the main property. Used as a garden shed, this crumbling and gloomy building was of little architectural merit. 

%p Our client's brief was to replace the building and create a flexible space that could be used as a light carpentry workshop and studio space.

%p Responding to the rudimentary nature of a garden shed, an emphasis was placed on simple building techniques and the tactile use of natural materials and finishes. A reinforced concrete raft with an upturned perimeter forms a durable floor finish and skirting detail upon which a timber frame sits. 

%p Externally the building is clad in hand charred vertical cedar boards with a corrugated metal roof. Set back from the low eaves that flanks the main garden space, a bespoke north facing roof light brings an even and diffused light to the interior and maximises internal head room. Internally the shed is finished with rough sawn larch boards hand fixed with cut nails. The roof light reveals are lined with planed larch boards and bespoke timber doors and casement windows are fitted with hand forged ironmongery. 

%p Planning approval was quickly granted for 'Dilapidated garden shed to be replaced with garden shed' and the project is fully compliant with building control.
