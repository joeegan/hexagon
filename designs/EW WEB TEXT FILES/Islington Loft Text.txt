Loft extensions to Victorian terraced houses are common place and typically comprise of a cramped room, small dormer window and awkward access. 

Through the re-interpretation of local planning policy we were able to deliver a different solution, providing space that is both generous and functional. In addition, an external terrace was created by replacing the pitched roof over the kitchen. 

The efficiency of the design generated a 55% increase in the usable internal floor area of the property. Planning approval was promptly granted without appeal.
