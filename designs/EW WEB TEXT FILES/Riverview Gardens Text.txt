Egan Wiesner worked closely with the client to transform this mansion block apartment through the remodelling of interior spaces and the introduction of new fittings, finishes and built in cabinetry throughout.

A license to alter was quickly acquired from the property management company to carry out the works which included the introduction of new acoustic flooring where kitchen and bathrooms were re-located.
